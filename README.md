# 💰 Data Science Salaries Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is an interactive **Tableau Dashboard** designed to analyze global trends in Data Science salaries. It explores the relationships between experience levels, employment types, company sizes, and geographic locations to understand what drives compensation in the AI and Data industry.


## ❓ Business Problem
The goal of this dashboard is to answer key questions for job seekers and recruiters:
*   How does experience level (Entry vs. Senior) impact salary expectations?
*   Which countries offer the highest volume of opportunities and the best pay?
*   How do salaries differ between specific roles (e.g., AI Architect vs. Data Analyst)?
*   What is the distribution of company sizes hiring for data roles?

## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings
Based on the visual analysis:
1.  **Experience Dominance:** The market is heavily skewed towards **Senior-level** professionals (approx. 65%), indicating a mature market valuing experience.
2.  **Geographic Hubs:** The **United States** is by far the largest employer in this dataset (12k+ records), followed significantly behind by Great Britain and Canada.
3.  **Company Size:** The vast majority of data science roles (~92%) are found in **Medium-sized companies**.
4.  **Salary Outliers:** Specific niche roles like **AI Architects** command the highest salaries, with intermediate-level contracts reaching up to $800k in specific instances.
5.  **Global Disparities:** The choropleth map highlights significant salary disparities between North America and other regions.

## 📈 Dashboard Features
The dashboard utilizes a dark-mode aesthetic for high contrast and includes the following visualizations:
*   **Global Salary Map:** A geographic heat map showing average USD salaries by country.
*   **Multi-Variable Scatter Plots:** Analyzing salary against experience level and employment type (Contract, Freelance, Full-Time).
*   **Donut & Semi-Donut Charts:** Visualizing the proportion of company sizes and experience levels.
*   **Detailed Matrix Table:** A granular look at average salaries broken down by specific Job Titles (e.g., AI Developer, Data Analyst) and Experience Levels.
*   **Interactive Filters:** Users can filter the entire view by **Job Title** and **Company Location**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
